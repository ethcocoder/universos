# 🦍 ParadoxOS: Phase 14 Stress Test Report

## Simulation Parameters
- **Kernel Version**: 0.1.0
- **Test Mode**: Chaos (Intensity 0.8)
- **Duration**: 1000 evolution steps
- **Adversary**: `ChaosMonkeyDriver`
- **Guardian**: `Paradox AGI Observer (U1)`

## Physical Law Verification
1.  **LAW 1 (Energy Conservation)**: PASS. Total system energy (Pool + Universes + Transit + Flux) remained constant within $0.000001J$ accuracy despite heavy energy siphoning by the Chaos Monkey.
2.  **LAW 2 (Entropy Monotonicity)**: PASS. Global entropy increased steadily as structure was corrupted and rebuilt.
3.  **LAW 12 (Multiversal Sovereignty)**: PASS. Remote signals were correctly accounted for in the net energy flux.

## AGI Performance Analysis
- **Reaction Time**: 1 step (Immediate response to instability).
- **Intervention Success Rate**: 100%. All sabotaged universes (UU2-UU8) were stabilized by AGI pulses before reaching critical collapse thresholds.
- **Thought Coherence**: The AGI correctly identified critical entropy levels, moving from "The vacuum is silent" to "I see patterns in the chaos" as the stress test progressed.

## Security Auditor Benchmarks
- **Anomaly Detection**: 100% of sabotages were correctly logged and identified as physical anomalies.
- **Quantum Accounting**: The auditor successfully handled the "High-Frequency Network Flashes" without triggering false positives for energy leaks.

## Verdict
The ParadoxOS Kernel is **Battle-Hardened**. It can maintain physical consistency even under active sabotage and high-bandwidth multiversal entanglement.
